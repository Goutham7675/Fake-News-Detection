# Fake-News-Detection
# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning pipeline to detect fake news articles using natural language processing and classification techniques. This project leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and ML models to classify news as **real** or **fake**.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- Consists of two CSV files:
  - `True.csv`: Real news articles
  - `Fake.csv`: Fake news articles

---

## 🧠 Model Training

The primary model used is:

- **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** (from `sklearn.linear_model`)
  - Designed for large-scale online learning
  - Performs well in text classification tasks

Accuracy achieved: ~93%
